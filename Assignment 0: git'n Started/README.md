You should maintain a local copy of the resources repo on your personal machine using git clone to make the initial copy, and git pull to update it.  Note that you will only be able to do this after completing Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the assignment.

Assignment Specification
Cheating Acknowledgement
Remember to sign and push the cheating acknowledgement if you want to receive a grade for the class.  If you are technologically unable to sign the document, pushing it will be interpreted as you having read the policy and agreeing to abide by it.

BEFORE THE DEADLINE in the textbox at the end of this page, submit the CommitID of whichever commit you want graded to Canvas. ONLY THE HASH! The hash can be found through git log -1. (It's also shown when you execute git commit.) Make sure that your chosen commit is also visible on our GitLab Instance or we can't grade it (aka: remember to git push).
